## Automobile foolproof bookkeeper using Blockchain technology
 
As the connected devices proliferate everywhere and the advent of autonomous vehicles are closer and closer, blockchain technology has the potential to support the safe and reliable autonomous vehicles. Blockchain will function as automobile foolproof bookkeeper, such as logging the mileage, repair/service records, and trips data. Other benefits include enabling more transparent true value of the automobile, allowing improved insurance rate, supporting car sharing/lease business.

## House Ledger on Blockchain

As more and more Real Estate frauds are increasing every year, there is no centralized reliable system to get authentic information. When people move to a new place they generally rent places and have to entirely rely on the dealer's words which may be misleading and not true and getting the historic and reliable information regarding cost and maintenance is very hard to find.
House Ledger will maintain authentic records of the house or apartment or land in the distributed blockchain network which can be trusted and easily accessible to any person or organization. It will help to prevent frauds and modification of information for monetary or other personal gains.

## Using Machine Learning to locate asteroids for mining

Space is the next frontier and with constantly depleting resources on Earth we look towards the stars to full our needs. Asteroids provide a rich mining site for all the resources we need to take humanity to next level ,there is over 2 trillion tonnes of water and more iron that earth's core available in close space region. A billion dollar industry has already popped around the prodigious goal of asteroid mining, the challenge is finding the right asteroid since it could cost millions just to deviate trajectory of a shuttle in space and there are over 150 million asteroids.

To solve this this challenge, we want to create a machine learning system that can give analysis on asteroids with highest set of minerals based on what end uers are looking for.
