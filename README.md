## Project : AutoChain - Built on Blockchain
 
As the connected devices proliferate everywhere and the advent of autonomous vehicles are closer and closer, blockchain technology has the potential to support the safe and reliable autonomous vehicles. Blockchain will function as automobile foolproof bookkeeper, such as logging the mileage, repair/service records, and trips data. Other benefits include enabling more transparent true value of the automobile, allowing improved insurance rate, supporting car sharing/lease business.
